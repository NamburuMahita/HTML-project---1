    <h1>S0LAR SYSTEM</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt> <b><u>OVERVIEW</u></b></dt>
        <dd> The solar system has one star, eight planets, five dwarf planets, at least 290 moons, more than 1.3 million asteroids, and about 3,900 comets. It is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center</dd>

       <h4> <u>STRUCTURE & COMPOSITION</u></h4>
       <P> The solar system consists of the Sun which is an average star in the Milky Way Galaxy & we have bodies orbiting around it: <strong>8 (formerly 9) planets</strong> with certain known planetary satellites (moons); countless asteroids, some of which have their own satellites; comets & other icy bodies; & vast reaches of highly tenuous gas & dust known as the interplanetary medium.

        The sun is located at the center of the solar system & it influences the motion of all the other bodies through its gravitational force The planets, in order of their distance outward from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, & Neptune.
        
       </P>
       <h4> <u>ORIGIN</u> </h4>
       <P> <i> <b>Edwin Hubble,</b> an American astronomer, discovered that universes are flying away from one another & it looked like chunks of celestial shrapnel in the effects of the titanic surge- Big Bang.

        <b>Big Bang Theory</b> reveals that the overall matter in the Universe came into life around 13.8 billion years ago. At the same time, the matter was consolidated into an incredibly tiny ball with vast consistency & intense heat labeled Singularity.</i></P>
        <h3> <u><em>PLANETS</em>  in our solar system</u> </h3>
        <P> <mark>here are totally 8 planets in our solar system .Initially 9 . <em>PLUTO</em>
            , the 9th planet is now considered as dwarf on</mark></P>
